                    <p>
                        Throughout my studies at Universitas Negeri Jakarta, I have familiarized myself with a variety of programming languages. 
                        In the first semester, I explored Python, which is widely adopted in the tech industry today, and DLang to strengthen my grasp of basic programming concepts. 
                        During the second semester, I focused on enhancing my understanding of data structures and algorithms using Python. 
                        Currently, in the third semester, I am learning object-oriented programming with C++ and developing web applications with HTML and CSS. 
                        These experiences with HTML and CSS have provided me with practical skills that will be instrumental in building and showcasing my future portfolio projects.
